## Wireframes and Structure

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. These were a rough idea of what I wanted to achieve, however I did make some changes to the structure of the page whilst coding, please see below for more information.

1. As shown in the wireframes, I first wanted to add the contact information below the about us section. However, whilst coding I realised that contact information is very important for the user and that  it would be handy to include it in the footer. This way the user can view the contact information on any page and it will also be a lot easier and quicker to find. 

2. I amended the structure of the menu and changed the name of 'bevergaes' to 'drinks'. I reliased that having the menu sections horizontally aligned wouldn't give me much space and it would have probably looked a little too constricted. 

3. I rearranged the layout of the gallery as I thought it looks neater when the photos are in two columns. 

4. After noticing that the home page looked too empty I decided to add the founders and our story section. 

5. While coding I decided to add a testimonials section to the events and bookings page to seperate the upcoming events section and the enquiries form. I think that this makes the page look more complete. I also added a map at the bottom of the enquiry form for good UI experience.
